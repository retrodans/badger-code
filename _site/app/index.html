This is just a quick trial blog I built using Jekyll and github-pages running through a tutorial found here: <http://24ways.org/2013/get-started-with-github-pages/>

To build this I had to use:

* redcarpet markdown
* github pages
* jekyll
* ruby gem

All in all, took me 30-60mins to quickly run through the tutorial properly, now I just need to flesh it out with some information about me.

Github Code (public)
--------------------
* badger-code - this little jekyll blog application
* [infocircle](https://github.com/retrodans/infocircle) - A simple little UI which I was asked to build for creativitea.  Has some nice little animations and rollover effects.  Works best with svg images if possible
* [timelapse](https://github.com/retrodans/timelapse/tree/develop) - an initial timelapse script written for my Raspberry pi.  It appeared to work on a basic level, but sadly the camera on the pi is super sensitive to static charges so I never managed to get a test to run longer than a few hours
* [RPi_PySnake](https://github.com/retrodans/RPi_PySnake) - A tutorial I ran through to create a snake game in python on my raspberry pi.  README.md included
* retrobadger - nothing, this is just a placeholder for when I was first setting up my github account
* gem install jekyll-minimagick

*I do have other code, but it is either in a private repo on github, or on a seperate svn host due to the old-school nature of some of it*
