My website: [retrobadger.net](http://www.retrobadger.net)

A quick intro from my website
> **Cultivating a better future, with the seeds of better websites**

> "Red Nose Day" and "Sport Relief" are two of the UKs biggest (and in my opinion best) charity campaigns both online and off.  They are dynamic, engaging, and technically complicated which has given me some fantastic challenges, which is what I will always enjoy.

> In my role of Senior Developer at Comic Relief, I feel that I get to plant a bit of me, and my passion, into every part of the website (ranging from UX standards through to drupal architecture, development, and server config).  I have also been involved in a number of corporate DM (Direct Marketing) projects, with new challenges to discuss, overcome, and learn from.

> Digital Consultancy, Web Development and Project Architecture are where I try to focus my skills, supporting my passion and desire to create stunning websites on time, in budget, and meeting your objectives.

> To build a powerful web presence, I combine my creative, technical, and managerial experience (alongside a good splash of passion) which I have cultivated over 10 years in the industry, creating websites people want to shout about.
